 building_type_curtain_walls_01:1 "Walls & Towers"
 building_type_curtain_walls_01_desc:1 "Stone walls and intimidating bastion towers offer excellent protection from both raids and sieges. The more fortifications built, the more impenetrable the castle which they protect becomes."
 building_curtain_walls_01:1 "Bastions & Curtain Walls"
 building_curtain_walls_01_desc:1 "The first step for any respectable fortification is the erection of bastions and curtain walls. They do a decent job of keeping enemies and rioting peasants at bay."
 building_curtain_walls_02:1 "Bailey"
 building_curtain_walls_02_desc:2 "The bailey is the most defensible place in which to store critical supplies to survive a siege: weapons, armor, and pickled boar's heads."
 building_curtain_walls_03:1 "Wall Towers"
 building_curtain_walls_03_desc:1 "Wall towers act as excellent vantage points, allowing our soldiers to snipe away at approaching armies safely. When not at war, they're excellent to gloat at peasants from."
 building_curtain_walls_04:1 "Second Curtain Wall"
 building_curtain_walls_04_desc:1 "The addition of a second curtain wall makes for an unsurpassed defensive position. If an enemy army manages to break through the first wall, they will be greeted by yet another — enough to demoralize any assailant!"
 building_curtain_walls_05:1 "Zwinger"
 building_curtain_walls_05_desc:1 "When an enemy army manages to break through the outer walls, they will unwittingly be funneled into the 'Zwinger' — also known as the #emphasis killing fields#!. Devilishly clever!"
 building_curtain_walls_06:1 "Outer Baileys"
 building_curtain_walls_06_desc:1 "More walls mean more baileys, and by extension, more safe storage for supplies. With baileys this many, we can even store an entire stable's worth of knightly mounts within the walls — an excellent thing, should we run out of pickled boar's heads..."
 building_curtain_walls_07:1 "Trace Italienne"
 building_curtain_walls_07_desc:1 "The Trace Italienne, or bastion fort, is a type of defensive structure that can resist even the relentless pounding of cannons. Well, not for very long, but at least for long enough to allow safe escape through the secret tunnels."
 building_curtain_walls_08:1 "Ravelins & Cavaliers"
 building_curtain_walls_08_desc:1 "The cavalier is a raised platform which allows our soldiers to fire over the main parapet, right at the enemies! Unfortunately, this also means that the enemies know exactly where to aim their shots... Though soldiers positioned on the ravelins, which are triangular outworks that divide besieging enemies, can do their best to prevent this from happening."
 
 building_type_cereal_fields_01:1 "Farms & Fields"
 building_type_cereal_fields_01_desc:1 "Farms and fields are the backbones of any economy. Fueling man, beast, army, and feast – there is no understating the power of simple grain."

 building_cereal_fields_03:1 "Barns & Storehouses"
 building_cereal_fields_03_desc:2 "The erection of barns and larger storehouses allows peasants to preserve hay and straw, gives them a place to store their tools, and acts as an impromptu roof for traveling armies and vagabonds alike."
 building_cereal_fields_04:1 "Farmsteads"
 building_cereal_fields_04_desc:2 "Larger farmsteads support larger peasant families. When families have space and means to grow, they will generate more children that can be put to toil in the fields."
 building_cereal_fields_05:1 "Granaries"
 building_cereal_fields_05_desc:2 "Granaries allow farmers to store cereals, dried meat, and other types of food throughout the winter. While not immune to mice and other pests, they at least keep their content dry."
 building_cereal_fields_06:1 "Granges & Tithe Barns"
 building_cereal_fields_06_desc:2 "Farmers safely collect the portion of their produce due to the clergy in tithe barns – of course, this also makes it easier for us to tax them."
 building_cereal_fields_07:1 "Vast Crop Fields"
 building_cereal_fields_07_desc:2 "By encouraging the peasantry to till more and larger fields close to each other's lands, we can increase productivity, although encroaching on each other's lands might bring conflict between the farmers."
 building_cereal_fields_08:1 "Grain Silos"
 building_cereal_fields_08_desc:2 "These massive silos store grain in vast quantities throughout the entire year, and even between years, and can support a truly massive population."

 building_barracks_02:1 "Levying Grounds"

 building_barracks_03:1 "Stone Barracks"
 building_barracks_03_desc:2 "The sturdier stone barracks offer significantly more protection from the elements, and the carrying of the stones is great training for our men."
 building_barracks_04:1 "Mobile Camps"
 building_barracks_04_desc:2 "While permanent barracks are useful for training, the availability of mobile camps made of tents increases our effectiveness in times of war, as the barracks can move together with the army."
 building_barracks_05:1 "Smithies"
 building_barracks_05_desc:2 "By enlisting camp smiths to maintain our levies' rusted spears and bent forks, we can make our troops more effective and at least a bit deadlier."
 building_barracks_06:1 "Training Grounds"
 building_barracks_06_desc:1 "By putting up training dummies and obstacle courses, we can sift the chaff from the wheat – and that way we know which men to put at the front of the formations."
 building_barracks_07:1 "Conscription Centers"
 building_barracks_07_desc:1 "By constructing dedicated conscription centers in all nearby villages, we ensure a steady stream of ill-willed, alcoholized troublemakers to swell our ranks."
 building_barracks_08:1 "Permanent Barracks"
 building_barracks_08_desc:2 "While we often have to move our levies at a moment's notice, the construction of permanent and well-built barracks allow us a place to house the more elite soldiers and officers."

 building_camel_farms_04_desc:1 "The market is always bustling with activity, with merchants trading hundreds of camels a day. This ensures that our breeders get access to the most resilient and enduring specimen."
 building_camel_farms_05:1 "Nomadic Recruitment Grounds"
 building_camel_farms_05_desc:1 "The fierce desert nomads make for excellent soldiers, but they don't work for free. By providing them with superior mounts as payment, we ensure their loyalty in future conflicts."
 building_camel_farms_06:1 "Military Stables"
 building_camel_farms_06_desc:1 "Grote and sturdy stables house our prized war camels, protecting them from both thieves and the harshness of the desert."
 building_camel_farms_07:1 "Armorers"
 building_camel_farms_07_desc:1 "Making armor for camels is not an easy task, but the reward is well worth it. A charge by fearsome fully-armored camels can make any horse-based army turn their tail and flee."
 building_camel_farms_08:1 "Advanced Breeders"
 building_camel_farms_08_desc:2 "Here, true experts of camel husbandry breed and raise the sturdiest and fiercest stocks of camels in the area."

 building_type_peat_quarries_01:1 "Wetland Farms"
 building_type_peat_quarries_01_desc:1 "While wetlands will never offer the same opportunities for growing crops as plains, a flourishing vegetation can support a good number of farm animals. There are also opportunities for extracting both peat and salt."
 building_peat_quarries_01:1 "Cattle Lands"
 building_peat_quarries_01_desc:2 "The fertility of the wetlands makes for excellent grazing land for pastoral animals of all sizes."
 building_peat_quarries_02:1 "Peat Quarries"

 building_peat_quarries_04:1 "Salt Wells"
 building_peat_quarries_04_desc:1 "Workers use large pans to heat water and extract salt from the wetlands. This salt is then used to preserve meat, which is then traded."
 building_peat_quarries_05:1 "Walled Wetlands"
 building_peat_quarries_05_desc:1 "By walling off the wetlands, the peasants can more easily control the growth of plants, and protect the valuable harvest therein."
