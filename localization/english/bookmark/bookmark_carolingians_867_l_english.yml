 bm_867_carolingians_desc:1 "Na het overlijden van Lodewijk de Vrome wordt zijn koninkrijk opgedeeld in drie rijken. Die van Oost-Francië, West-Francië, en het Koninkrjik Lotharingen. Sindsdien worden deze rijken geteisterd door oorlogen, opstanden en erfopvolgingen die zorgen voor verdere instabiliteit en fragmentatie door het grote deel van Europa, wat eens het Frankische Rijk besloeg.\n\n#bold Zal één van deze Karolingen sterk genoeg zijn om het konkrijk van hun voorouders te verenigen? Of zullen hun familie geschillen hen openstellen voor invloeden van buitenaf?#!"

 #Charles the Bald

 bookmark_carolingians_charles_the_bald_desc:0 "At the time of Charles' birth, his fully grown half-brothers already ruled their own kingdoms within the Carolingian empire. Without a crown of his own, he became known as 'the Bald,' though he eventually did inherit Aquitaine and West Francia. In the future he will even inherit Italy and the Holy Roman Empire itself, but his line will not persevere — his last grandson will die childless just seven years after his own death.\n\n#bold Can you change the course of history and ensure a long and prosperous line of Charles' decedents?#!"

These ambitions have suffered from setback after setback however, as his various military campaigns all ended in failure and his rebellious sons have pried away most of his own lands from his control.\n\n#bold Can you reverse Ludwig's misfortunes and regain the Empire for his descendants, or are his sons destined to be relegated to a mere footnote in history?#!"

Saddled with quarrelsome neighbors and an unstable realm, Louis II will die before siring a son.\n\n#bold Can you regain all the lost territories of the Empire and reestablish the Imperial Crown as a real power?#!"
